# notetaker
An application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. It utilizes an Express back-end and saves and retrives note data from a `db.json` file.

## Description
This application can be used by anyone for note-taking purposes, whether at work for tasks or at home for personal use.

## Installation
In order to install the necessary packages, run `npm install` from the command line while inside the root directory. Documentation for Express can be found at https://www.npmjs.com/package/express.

## Usage
Run `node server.js` on the command line from the "Develop" directory, and the console will alert the user to the `PORT` that the application is listening on. On a browser, the user should visit `http://localhost:` followed by the `PORT` number displayed in the console. The user will land on a home page with a link to a page where they can access previously saved notes, save new notes, and delete notes.
